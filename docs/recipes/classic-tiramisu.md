## Information

- **Prep Time**: 30 minutes
- **Chill Time**: 4-6 hours (or overnight)
- **Total Time**: 4 hours 30 minutes - 6 hours 30 minutes
- **Servings**: 8-10 people
- **Difficulty**: Medium

## Ingredients

### For the Coffee Mixture
- 1½ cups strong espresso or coffee, cooled
- 3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (Kahlúa or Marsala wine, optional)
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar

### For the Mascarpone Cream
- 6 large egg yolks
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- 1¼ cups mascarpone cheese, room temperature
- 1¾ cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### For Assembly
- 2 packages (7 oz each) ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)
- Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting
- Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare coffee mixture**: In a shallow dish, combine cooled espresso, coffee liqueur (if using), and 2 tablespoons sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Set aside.

2. **Make the cream base**: In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks and ¾ cup sugar until thick and pale (about 5 minutes). Add mascarpone and vanilla, whisking until smooth and no lumps remain.

3. **Whip the cream**: In a separate bowl, whip heavy cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in three additions until just combined.

4. **Dip the ladyfingers**: Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 2-3 seconds (don't oversoak). Arrange in a single layer in a 9x13 inch dish or large serving dish.

5. **Layer the cream**: Spread half of the mascarpone cream evenly over the ladyfingers. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers and cream, creating two distinct layers.

6. **Chill**: Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow flavors to meld and layers to set.

7. **Serve**: Before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve. Add chocolate shavings if desired.

## Tips

!!! tip "Pro Tips"
    - Use room temperature mascarpone to avoid lumps in the cream
    - Don't oversoak the ladyfingers or they'll become mushy
    - For best flavor, make tiramisu a day ahead and let it chill overnight
    - Use a fine-mesh sieve for even cocoa powder dusting
    - If you can't find mascarpone, substitute with cream cheese mixed with heavy cream
    - For alcohol-free version, omit the coffee liqueur and add extra vanilla

## Variations

- **Chocolate Tiramisu**: Add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder to the mascarpone cream
- **Berry Tiramisu**: Layer with fresh berries between the cream layers
- **Individual Portions**: Assemble in glasses or ramekins for elegant single servings

## Storage

Cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Tiramisu actually improves in flavor after the first day as the layers meld together. Do not freeze as the texture will be compromised.
