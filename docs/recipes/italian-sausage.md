- 2 tablespoons fennel seeds, crushed or ground
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder

- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander (optional)
- 2 tablespoons cold water (if mixture seems too dry)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare workspace**: Set up a large mixing bowl and have all seasonings measured and ready. Work with cold meat for best texture.

2. **Combine dry seasonings**: In a small bowl, mix together salt, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, and coriander (if using).

3. **Add meat to bowl**: Place the ground pork in a large mixing bowl. If using a combination of meats, mix them together first.

4. **Season the meat**: Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the ground meat. Add cold water if the mixture appears too dry.

5. **Mix thoroughly**: Using your hands (wear gloves if preferred), gently but thoroughly mix the seasonings into the meat. Work quickly to avoid warming the meat. Mix until seasonings are evenly distributed.

6. **Test seasoning**: Form a small patty (about 2 tablespoons) and cook it in a skillet to taste. Adjust seasonings if needed.

7. **Rest the mixture**: Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead.

8. **Form patties**: Shape into desired portion sizes. For standard patties, use about 2 ounces (¼ cup) per patty.

9. **Cook sausage**: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties for 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C). Work in batches to avoid overcrowding.
