## Information

- **Prep Time**: 30 minutes
- **Cook Time**: 45 minutes
- **Total Time**: 1 hour 15 minutes
- **Yield**: 6 bottles (12 oz each)
- **Difficulty**: Medium

## Ingredients

- 8 cups of pitted peaches results in about 6 cups of ground peaches
- 3¾ or more cups granulated sugar
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 7 table spoons powdered pectin in ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp butter (optional, to reduce foaming)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare peaches**: Pit and chop peaches into small pieces in the Cuisinart. You should have about 6 cups of prepared fruit.

2. **Sterilize jars**: Wash 6 twelve-ounce canning jars and lids in hot soapy water. Keep jars hot in a 200°F oven or hot water bath until ready to use.

3. **Mix pectin**: In a small bowl, mix the powdered pectin with ¼ cup of the measured sugar. Set aside.

4. **Cook jam**: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine chopped peaches and lemon juice. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, stirring frequently.

5. **Add pectin**: Stir in the pectin-sugar mixture. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

6. **Add remaining sugar**: Add the remaining 3¾ cups sugar all at once. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add butter if desired to reduce foaming.

7. **Fill jars**: Remove from heat. Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving ¼ inch headspace. Wipe jar rims clean and apply lids and rings finger-tight.

8. **Process jars**: Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes (for altitude of 6700ft). Remove and let cool completely. Check that lids have sealed properly.

## Tips

!!! tip "Pro Tips"
    - Choose peaches that are ripe but still firm for the best texture
    - Don't double the recipe - pectin works best in smaller batches
    - Skim foam during cooking for a clearer jam
    - Test for gel point with a candy thermometer: jam is ready at 220°F
    - If jam doesn't set properly, you can re-cook with additional pectin
