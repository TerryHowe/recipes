Add meat to bowl : Place the ground pork in a large mixing bowl. If using a combination of meats, mix them together first. Season the meat : Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the ground meat. Add cold water if the mixture appears too dry. Mix thoroughly : Using your hands (wear gloves if preferred), gently but thoroughly mix the seasonings into the meat. Work quickly to avoid warming the meat. Mix until seasonings are evenly distributed. Test seasoning : Form a small patty (about 2 tablespoons) and cook it in a skillet to taste. Adjust seasonings if needed. Rest the mixture : Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead. Form patties : Shape into desired portion sizes. For standard breakfast patties, use about 2 ounces (\u00bc cup) per patty. Cook sausage : Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties for 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). Work in batches to avoid overcrowding. Tips \u00b6 Pro Tips Keep meat cold throughout preparation for best texture Don't overmix the meat to avoid tough sausage Test cook a small portion before forming all patties to adjust seasoning Formed patties can be frozen between parchment paper for up to 3 months For links, stuff mixture into natural casings using a sausage stuffer Double the recipe if you want to freeze portions for later use Storage \u00b6 Fresh sausage : Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Cooked sausage : Store in refrigerator for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 2 months.

Perfect for spreading on toast, biscuits, or using in desserts. Information \u00b6 Prep Time : 30 minutes Cook Time : 45 minutes Total Time : 1 hour 15 minutes Yield : 6 bottles (12 oz each) Difficulty : Medium Ingredients \u00b6 8 cups of pitted peaches results in about 6 cups of ground peaches 3\u00be or more cups granulated sugar \u00bc cup fresh lemon juice 7 table spoons powdered pectin in \u00bc cup granulated sugar 1 tsp butter (optional, to reduce foaming) Instructions \u00b6 Prepare peaches : Pit and chop peaches into small pieces in the Cuisinart.

Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Add pectin : Stir in the pectin-sugar mixture. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add remaining sugar : Add the remaining 3\u00be cups sugar all at once. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add butter if desired to reduce foaming. Fill jars : Remove from heat. Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving \u00bc inch headspace. Wipe jar rims clean and apply lids and rings finger-tight. Process jars : Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes (for altitude of 6700ft). Remove and let cool completely. Check that lids have sealed properly. Tips \u00b6 Pro Tips Choose peaches that are ripe but still firm for the best texture Don't double the recipe - pectin works best in smaller batches Skim foam during cooking for a clearer jam Test for gel point with a candy thermometer: jam is ready at 220\u00b0F If jam doesn't set properly, you can re-cook with additional pectin Storage \u00b6 Properly sealed jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.
