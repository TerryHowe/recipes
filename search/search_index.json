Perfect for spreading on toast, biscuits, or using in desserts. Information \u00b6 Prep Time : 30 minutes Cook Time : 45 minutes Total Time : 1 hour 15 minutes Yield : 6 bottles (12 oz each) Difficulty : Medium Ingredients \u00b6 8 cups of pitted peaches results in about 6 cups of ground peaches 3\u00be or more cups granulated sugar \u00bc cup fresh lemon juice 7 table spoons powdered pectin in \u00bc cup granulated sugar 1 tsp butter (optional, to reduce foaming) Instructions \u00b6 Prepare peaches : Pit and chop peaches into small pieces in the Cuisinart. You should have about 6 cups of prepared fruit. Sterilize jars : Wash 6 twelve-ounce canning jars and lids in hot soapy water. Keep jars hot in a 200\u00b0F oven or hot water bath until ready to use. Mix pectin : In a small bowl, mix the powdered pectin with \u00bc cup of the measured sugar. Set aside. Cook jam : In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine chopped peaches and lemon juice. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Add pectin : Stir in the pectin-sugar mixture. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add remaining sugar : Add the remaining 3\u00be cups sugar all at once. Return to a full rolling boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add butter if desired to reduce foaming. Fill jars : Remove from heat. Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving \u00bc inch headspace. Wipe jar rims clean and apply lids and rings finger-tight. Process jars : Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes (for altitude of 6700ft). Remove and let cool completely. Check that lids have sealed properly. Tips \u00b6 Pro Tips Choose peaches that are ripe but still firm for the best texture Don't double the recipe - pectin works best in smaller batches Skim foam during cooking for a clearer jam Test for gel point with a candy thermometer: jam is ready at 220\u00b0F If jam doesn't set properly, you can re-cook with additional pectin Storage \u00b6 Properly sealed jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Once opened, refrigerate and use within 3 weeks. Unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 3 weeks.","title":"Peach Jam"},{"location":"recipes/peach-jam/#peach-jam","text":"A delicious homemade peach jam that captures the sweet essence of summer peaches.

Ingredients - About 2 \u00bd cups milk - 3 or 4 egg yolks, slightly beaten - \u00bc cup sugar - \u215b teaspoon salt - 1 teaspoon vanilla, rum, or dry sherry - A little grated lemon rind Directions 1. Scald the milk. 2. Stir it slowly into the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a double boiler. 3. Place the custard over (not in) hot water. Stir constantly until it begins to thicken. 4. Cool. 5. Add vanilla, rum, or sherry, and lemon rind. 6. Chill thoroughly. This isn\u2019t as firm as baked custard since stirring disturbs the thickening. It\u2019s really more like a custard sauce. Trifle (according to my mom) \u00b6 Layers - Ladyfingers (stale is better) - Bananas, sliced - Marmalade (not too sweet) - Custard sauce (from above) - Optional: Meyers rum Directions 1. Lay down a layer of ladyfingers. 2. Add sliced bananas on top. 3. Drop marmalade around the bananas. 4. Repeat for a couple of layers. 5. Pour the custard sauce over everything. 6. Let it soak overnight or at least a few hours. - You can sprinkle rum and let that soak in too. Notes - A double boiler can be rigged up any old way, just make sure the mixture isn\u2019t sitting directly on the heat. - It\u2019s best to make the sauce a day ahead, then build the dessert and let it sit in the fridge. - Really, it\u2019s better if it sits awhile.
